# OpenROAD - GSoC 2026 Organization Application

## Basic Information

### Organization Name
**The OpenROAD Project**

### Short Description
An open-source, autonomous RTL-to-GDSII flow for chip design that enables 24-hour layout implementation without human intervention, democratizing hardware innovation.

### Long Description
The OpenROAD Project is an open-source hardware design initiative originally launched through DARPA's IDEA program. It develops autonomous, no-human-in-loop Electronic Design Automation (EDA) tools that enable complete RTL-to-GDSII chip design flows.

The project addresses the "design cost crisis" in semiconductor development by eliminating barriers of cost, expertise, and uncertainty in advanced technologies. OpenROAD delivers a complete register-transfer level (RTL) to graphic data system (GDSII) design flow, integrating open-source tools like Yosys for synthesis, TritonFPlan for floorplanning, and TritonRoute for routing.

OpenROAD supports multiple process design kits (PDKs), from open-source options like GF180 and SkyWater130 to proprietary advanced nodes such as TSMC65, GF12, Intel22, and Intel16. The project aims to establish the "Linux of EDA" - creating tapeout-capable tools with permissive licensing that democratize chip design and enable rapid innovation in hardware.

In 2024-2025, OpenROAD has expanded significantly with industry adoption, including Intel's use of GenAI with OpenROAD for intelligent chip design, IHP offering shuttle services for fab-ready designs, and recognition by the FOSSi Foundation as a key component of Europe's Open EDA ecosystem roadmap.
